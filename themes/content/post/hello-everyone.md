# Welcome to my R blog!
<!-- more -->
Hello and welcome to my R blog. 

I'm an R enthusiast with over 6 years of R experience. Starting out at University I was taught by Peter Dalgaard (R core) in statistics and R's role as a statistics software. Since then I've used my knowledge to program Data Science solutions including Credit Risk Models, solutions to Linear and Non-linear programming problems, R packages for data manipulation and database integrations and general machine learning. 

On this blog I'm intending to write about my work, package developing, data analysis and much much more! Starting out I'll be using it to talk about using the TidyModels universe (and extensions) to analyse data problems, ranging from classic statistical problems, machine learning to advanced hierachical and bayesian models. My focus is going to be varied but likely within a Financial setting as this is where I usually reside. Sprinkled in I will be including posts about developing packages and this very blog site! 

Are you in to R, and are you looking for a very detail oriented blog which will be going into the nitty gritty of optimizing R code then you are in luck! I'll be diving into the source code of packages for inspiration, spent time on profiling and benchmarking and show how you can optimize your code to the reach the next level of R performance!
